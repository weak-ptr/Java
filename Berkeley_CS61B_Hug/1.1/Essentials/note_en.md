#  Essentials
##  First Java Program
- syntax
  - all Java program need a **class declaration**(unlike c/c++), by using **public class** keywords. In Java, all code lives inside of classes.
  - the code that is run is inside of a method called main, which is declared as **public static void main(String[] args)**(can't do any modify).
  - use curly braces **{}** to denote the beginning and the end of a section of code.
  - Statements must end with **semi-colons**.

##  Compile and Run program
- compile
  - a java source file(xxx.java) compile by **javac(java compiler)** to a java class file.
- run
  - a java JVM can analysis a java class file, and run it.
